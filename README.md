Understanding sentence structure is crucial for NLP applications. This project aims to identify Turkish sentence elements using Named Entity Recognition (NER) in a token classification framework. The agglutinative and rich morphological structure of Turkish poses challenges for NLP tasks. This research aims to develop a robust model to accurately classify and identify sentence components such as subjects, objects, predicates and determiners.

A deep learning approach is used to fine-tune a pre-trained BERTurk model on a dataset of labeled Turkish sentences. The model is trained to recognize and label tokens corresponding to various sentence elements, which allows for detailed sentence structure analysis. 

This study aims to provide a dataset that can meet the needs of future work in this field and to contribute to deep learning-based shallow parser approaches.
